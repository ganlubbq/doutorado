function Sest = cosaomp(Phi,u,K,tol,maxiterations)

% CosaOMP algorithm
%   Input
%       K : sparsity of Sest
%       Phi : measurement matrix
%       u: measured vector
%       tol : tolerance for approximation between successive solutions. 
%   Output
%       Sest: Solution found by the algorithm
%
% Algorithm as described in "CoSaMP: Iterative signal recovery from 
% incomplete and inaccurate samples" by Deanna Needell and Joel Tropp,
% but now using an orthogonal projection step to update residual (added by
% Bob L. Sturm 20110707
% 
% This implementation was written by David Mary, 
% but modified 20110707 by Bob L. Sturm to make it much clearer,
% and corrected multiple times again and again.
