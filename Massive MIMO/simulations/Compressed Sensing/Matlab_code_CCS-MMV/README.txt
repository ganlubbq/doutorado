In [1], a fast and accurate algorithm in presented for off-grid DOA estimation.
In [2], the off-grid DOA estimation problem is generalized and analyzed in the framework of compressed sensing. We provide some theoretic guarantees and demonstrate its application to DOA estimation.
In [3], a discretization-free sparse method is firstly ever introduced for continuous DOA estimation which completely eliminates basis mismatches in existing discretization-based methods.
In [4], we present a systematic discretization-free/gridless sparse method for continuous frequency estimation with automatic model order selection, and analyze its connection to existing atomic norm-based methods.
In [5], we propose a reweighted atomic norm minimization method to achieve high resolution and sparsity for gridless frequency estimation.
