BEFORE USING FOR THE FIRST TIME:
-you must execute the following two matlab commands:
   mex -largeArrayDims ldpc_generate1.c
   mex -largeArrayDims ldpc_h2g1.c
 which will provide the platform-specific files ldpc_generate1.mex* and ldpc_h2g1.mex*

Essential files:
1) noncoh2.m -- the main file.  running without arguments uses the defaults set at the beginning of the file.
2) prop_chan.m -- called by noncoh2 to generate a UWB channel realization 
3) mc_decode2.m -- called by noncoh2 to do Markov-chain decoding
4) softdecode.m -- called by noncoh2 to do soft symbol decoding
5) ldpc_decode1.m -- called by noncoh2 to do LDPC decoding 
6) gmstats_*.mat -- channel statistics loaded by noncoh2 and user generated (when needed) by ofdm_chan.m
7) pargen/pargen_*.mat -- LDPC code matrices loaded by noncoh2 and generated (when needed) via... 
8) ldpc_generate1.mex* -- called by noncoh2 to do LDPC code matrix design
9) ldpc_h2g1.mex* --  called by noncoh2 to do LDPC code matrix design 

Optional files:
1) ofdm_chan.m -- used to generate OFDM channel statistics.  you will need to run this iff you change the UWB channel parameters.
2) ldpc_generate1.m -- help file for ldpc_generate1.mex*
3) ldpc_h2g1.m -- help file for ldpc_h2g1.mex*

Optional external packages:
1) SPGL1 software (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spgl1/) provides LASSO/BPDN reconstruction algorithms that are needed if you turn on the LASSO options.
