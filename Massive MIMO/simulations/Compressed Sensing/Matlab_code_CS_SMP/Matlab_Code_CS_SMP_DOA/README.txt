Thank you for your interest in our work.

The main function AA_P_BPDN_DOA.m implements the algorithm in the following paper for off-grid frequency estimation:
Z. Yang, C. Zhang, and L. Xie, "Robustly stable signal recovery in compressed sensing with structured matrix perturbation," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 60, no. 9, pp. 4658--4671, 2012.

To run the code, you need to install the cvx toolbox that can be freely downloaded online.

The Matlab code here is for the purpose of simple illustration but far from efficient.

In [1], a fast and accurate algorithm in presented for off-grid DOA estimation.
In [2], a discretization-free/gridless sparse method is firstly ever introduced for continuous DOA estimation which completely eliminates basis mismatches in existing discretization-based methods.
In [3], we present a systematic discretization-free/gridless sparse method for continuous frequency estimation with automatic model order selection, and analyze its connection to existing atomic norm-based methods.
In [4], the gridless sparse technique for frequency recovery, referred to as continuous CS, is firstly studied with multiple measurement vectors.
In [5], the problem of joint sparse frequency recovery with multiple measurement vectors is theoretically analyzed in the noiseless case.
In [6], we propose a reweighted atomic norm minimization method to achieve high resolution and sparsity for gridless frequency estimation.

The Matlab codes of the above papers will be published on my personal website when available.
